      <div class="text-justify text-box">
        <p>Gta San Andreas is a sandbox videogame produced by rockstar games, it was launched in 2004 for ps2, pc and xbox.</p>
        <p>Grand theft auto san andreas was a big revolution in video games industry, in its launching also it is my favorite game, a big artwork and I am going to show you why.</p>
        <p>The game’s history is very involving, Carl Johnson (CJ) after living a few years on Liberty City is back in his native city Los Santos because his mom was murdered by the enemy gang Los ballas. But as soon as he arrives is intercepted by corrupt
          policies that are working with all of the city gangs and obligates him to join in the business (if not, he could be incriminated by killing a police officer). CJ meets again with his family and his gang Groove Street and together they begins to
          recover the gang’s presence in the city. But CJ and his brother (Sweet) are betrayed by one of their friends, so Sweet is arrested and CJ must leave Los Santos, for this reason he must manage to come back and stop Los Ballas to recover his whole
          city. In the process we embody CJ and we meet fresh and unique characters. This is one of the facts that makes great this game: each one of the characters is powerful and has its purposes well defined. The story feels nature, you really feel like
          a gangster and sometimes will want to kill Ryder but I’m gonna let covered the entire spot so you can enjoy it for yourself.</p>
        <p>One of the things that I do love of the game and keep me entertained is the size of the whole map, and the differentiation between each city, when you are in Los Santos, you really know about the ghetto and they are contrasted with richest parts
          of the city, or the commercial zone. Same in San Fierro (where the counter culture predominates) and Las Venturas (where you will find lots of joy), each city has their own citizens, radio catalog, cars and the way in which the developers take
          advantage of the render distance makes that the player feels the map like a gigantic map in which drive from one side to the other is quite chill and interesting.
          The soundtrack is simply awesome, it has 80’s and 90’s songs, that are played according to the city in which you are and always converts a driving into a chill road across your loved city.</p>
        <p>Getting deeper in the game, the missions are varied and interesting, some are difficult and always are strongly related with the history (even the secondary ones), but sometimes there you will find a couple of missions that are boring or they
          wasn’t designed to fit with the game’s mechanics (which certainly are very intuitive). There’s one thing that honestly I don’t like as much: the driving mechanics, it’s okay but it could be better. I mean, driving in the game is pretty cool and
          all the vehicles are different and you upgrade your skills with the time but it doesn’t feels so natural, it feels as if the car was sliding on the road.</p>
        <p>If you have played San Andreas before, you know that you never can’t get bored of this game, if you don’t want to follow the history path, you could try to be “serious” and respect the traffic signals, or explore the whole map, be a policeman, a
          bomberman, even drive an ambulance a taxi or even a pimp’s car and make its business. But the most pretty common: kill everyone and try to reach the five stars in the your hunting level.</p>
        <p>By the way, playing GTA SA, is like magic, and I know that almost every recent game owns this qualities, but we are talking about a 2004’s game, it was an inflection point on the industry and a bunch of generations get enrolled with this game at
          least one time, maybe the first gamer experience for some of us. it deserves totally be called as one of the biggest games of the history.</p>
