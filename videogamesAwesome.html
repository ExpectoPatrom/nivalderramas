              <p>Some people think that videogames are a waste of time or might be a bad thing for their kids. But when you talk with kids about it, they’re excited and if you tell their that it is not a waste of time, they will feel identified. <br><br>
                There is a program that carry kids to game dev studios to teach and include them into the creative process then, when a kid arrives to the studio he is excited have thousands of ideas and is an expert of videogames (The average kid has played almost 10,000 hours of games.) so he can provide great value to the studio.<br><br></p>

        <p>What? Working at videogames? In fact, videogames industry revenues are bigger than any other industry in the entire world, there are good paid jobs and many offers in the country (Canada).<br></p>
        <p>
        There are other interesting facts about videogames that people often ignore like; 50% of the gamers are women. Kids don’t play instead of going out, kids play videogames instead of watching tv (what is great). And, since internet and technology has evolved videogames had become a great way to connect people, shorten distances and break loneliness.<br>
        Three reasons why videogames are awesome:
        <ul>
          <li>Videogames ignite passion. They can lead a great artist (it is more that playing videogames but videogames could be the start).</li>
          <li>As above said, videogames connect us.</li>
          <li>Videogames can end discrimination: when you play a videogame, it does not matter your race, your gender or your opinions, just matter how good you are at the game.
          </li>
        </ul>
        At the end of the talk, Eric tells us a personal anecdote that might reshape our thoughts and make us want to play some videogame with our close people.
