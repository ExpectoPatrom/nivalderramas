    <p>I am a curious boy, who likes to rethink the world to create an improved reality. Because now
      we are living in the future, in this age all of us have the power to create, to empower the
      whole humanity and lead it to a more evolved society. Since I realized that the only way to
      achieve that was by educating and transforming myself, I have chased this rough path to
      knowledge and innovation.</p>
    <p>At the university, I have developed a few projects that have taught me and raised my skills
      but one of my greater experiences was designing an operative system that just works for me
      and covers my necessities. Using <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">arch</a> as the base of my system I enjoyed learning lua to
      program my environment <a href="https://awesomewm.org">awesome window manager</a> and figuring out how the linux
      filesystem works but I struggled when managing my <a href="https://github.com/ExpectoPatrom/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>, also I realized that I need to
      improve my bash scripting skills and learn low-level development with c++ . I achieved a
      lightweight workstation, with a fast and fancy user interface that improves my experience
      while I am using it and keeps me going deeper in this amazing world. This adventure
      changed my day by day while using a personal computer and made me rethink about the
      global misconception that people has about tech and how it fits in their culture, I earned
      liberty, privacity, a huge knowledge and at the most important: I knew the tech community
      and got involved in it, now I keep learning from people around the world, reshaping my own
      culture and knowledge.</p>
    <p>In a videogame we have the ability to train our player; the game engine works in an
      algorithmic way and has mechanic and axiomatic limits. It means that this is the fastest and
      most effective way to rewire the neuronal connections and make a human able to interact
      intuitively with a machine. Also, a video game requires a huge art component, drawers, music
      composers, 3d modelers it implies more people shaping their thoughts on the game, and after
      a long time the video game is ready for its launch. Gaming industry is transforming pop

      culture and the way that people consume entertainment and has a big revenue (almost $18.4
      billion only in US). So we can say, that a videogame results into a big artwork, culture,
      economy and education; a cross product capable of transforming the humanity.</p>
    <p>That is why I want to research in the human-machine interaction field to understand how
      technology is getting into our whole world and how it could be more useful to fulfill our
      necessities as automating processes or tracking habits to make technology an extension of .
      Also I plan develop a broader vision to be able to develop quality games and products that
      implicitly teach people how to optimize their day by day and how to be more creative. With
      technology, we can reach the majority of the world population and help them with the lowest
      costs we can imagine.<br>
      Also, we can recollect a huge data-set with every game launched, helping to understand how
      every human being perceives and interact with some interfaces and realities.<br>
      It is a loop, and people are our parameterâ€™s loop, if we input lazy and ignorant people, we
      return bad generations and verticalized power schemes that are going to send more ignorant
      people at the beginning of the loop. But if we have intelligent, creative and individual people
      we will make a step and then another step to break the loop and we will achieve a more
      developed culture and society.</p>
