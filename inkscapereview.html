      </div>
      <div class="text-justify text-box">
        <p>Inkscape is an open source software for vectorial design, it has a strong support and an increasing community it also includes documentation and tutorials for almost every level and purpose and even when it does not exists, you can handle it with the community tutorials.</p>
        <p>I’m not a designer, in contrast I’m an engineering student who likes design, color and human interfaces, often I try to design my own widgets, icons and beginner stuff. Paying something expensive like the adobe suite is not suitable for me, so Inkscape is the best option for getting deeper in design and learning new things in your free time. And trust me, the results can be as professional as a design made in Illustrator could be.
          Inkscape comes pretty nice for almost any situation, one thing that I love in this software is that it runs in every computer, even with 2gb ram and a pentium processor you could install it and make some pretty stuff.</p>
        <p>It’s interface is not as simply as I would like, it could be better organized and be more intuitive or responsive sometimes I pass long sessions searching for that tool that once I used, but once you get comfortable with it you start being very productive. It’s customizable, which is a good point: you can change the theme, the icons or the colors even if you are experienced with code and configuration files, you can design your own themes if not you always can find newer themes on the community blogs. Learning Inkscape is a piece of cake, even if is your first time using a vector graphics software or you don’t have idea what is a vector (like me when start using it), with a few hours you will be making your very firsts designs. But believe me, watching tutorials and blogs will help you a lot.</p>
        <p>Inkscape tools are simply great. Each time I find a new tool I use it until I get bored of this, they are easy to use and with a little of creativity and being tricky you can achieve uncredible effects. I don’t know even the 30% percent of tools that inkscape has but it is because there are too much (at least for me), and I know Illustrator has huge more, but men Inkscape is free and it keeps under rolling release so keep calm, you will achieve almost anything with inkscape. Another important fact is the pallet color: it is not a single pallet color, there are 25 different palettes to find your own style.
        </p>
        <p>The docks (for some tools) are not well positioned, none of the three modes was easy and comfortable to use for me, so I handled to get used with the semi-floating docks, which comes nice with my tiling window manager. I think that interface was just designed for big screens or two monitors, but that is not my situation.</p>
        <p>I do recommend you using Inkscape, just give a try to the software and to the designing world, I’ve made some sprites and illustrations here and I’m happy with what I have learned. You might be find your new hobby and why not, your next job.</p>
